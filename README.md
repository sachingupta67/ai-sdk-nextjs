# ‚ö° Stream Text Response

AI models can be **slow** ‚è≥, especially for long answers.
Users may end up staring at a **spinner for 5, 10, or even 20 seconds** ‚Äî not a great experience.

‚úÖ Instead of waiting for the **entire response**, start **streaming text** as soon as the AI begins generating it.
This gives a smooth **ChatGPT-like experience** ‚ú®.

## What is AI Model
- An AI Model is
  - a program that has been trained on set of data
  - to recognize patterns
  - make predictions
  - without human interventions

ex: 
- a really smart assistant who read millions of books and can help you write, analyze, or create based on that knowledge
- AI models power everything from the autocomplete in your phone's keyboard to self-driving cars

Types of Models
1.  Text Generation Models (Language Models)
  - they process and generate human-like text
  - perfect for everything from writing and analysis to conversation and code

  Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - They are "large" because they havebeen trained on absolutely massive amounts of text data
  - GPT-4 has been trained on hundreds of billions of words

  Example - GPT-4 from OpenAI, Claude from Anthropic, and Gemini from Google



2. Embedding Models
   - instead of generating text, they convert text into numbers - specially ,vectors that capture the meaning of text

   -  Imagine if you could turn the meaning of sentence into set of a cordinates on a map, Similar meaning would be close together on that map

   - You might not use directly as often , but they are working behind the scenes in feature like content recommendations.

   Ex: you find an "italian restraunts" when you search for 'pasta places ' 

3. Image Models
   - These either generate images from text descriptions and analyze existing images

   Ex: MidJourney, GPT Models from OPENAI - Dall-E , Flux

   Perfect for generating product images, analyze uploaded photos , or creating visual content on the fly

4- Multi Model Models:
 - Swiss army knives for AI World
 - these can handle multiple type of input and output 
 - Feed them text, images, or sometimes even audio , and they wil process it all
 - They are incredibly versatile but often come with higher costs

 Ex: GPT-4 , Claude-4 , Gemini fall into this category


Model Characterstics
- Context window
  - how much information a model can process in a single conversation
  - think of it as model's working memory 
  - some model can only handles a few pages of text at once, while others can process entire books
  - if you are building document analysis app , you will want  a model with large context window
  - for simple Q&A or basic chat , a model with smaller context windows works just fine

-2 Intelligence
  - determine how well amodel understand nuance , follow complex instructions and generates high-quality output
  - less capable model are great for straight forward tasks like Answering FAQ,categorizing text or following templates
  - when you need creativity , complex problem-solving or understanding Context and subtext, you reach for the more capable models
  - always match your model to your task complexity

-3 Speed
  - all about response time
  - if users are waiting for a response , like in a chat interface , you need speed
  - if you are generating reports in the background , use a slower model with better quality

-4 Cost
  - faster, larger, smarteer context windows models cost more
  - use cheaper models during development


# Choosing the right model condition
- For real time features like autocomplete or a simple chat interface , speed is king.
  User expect instant response so pick fast model , even if it's not the smartest

- for generating content, quality beats speed. User will wait a extra second or two or four for better writing so pick a more
  intelligent model

- for analyzing document , you need large context window to fit everything. Don't try to squeeze a large PDF through a small model

- Always test and experiment with different models to find the right balance for your use case

Ex: Choosing between a sports car and a city car - both get you where you need to go , but one is for performance while other is built for efficiency


# Provides (who create and maintain the models)
ex: if models are the car, then provides are the manufacturers

so Companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc are like your FORM, BMW, and mercedes of the AI World

Each providers invests hunderededs of millions in search, has their own approach and offers different streghts


# Choosing a provider
- Reliability - how stable is their service
- Pricing  - what's your budget
- Features - Do they offer what you need
- Privacy - How do they handle your data


# How to change AI Models with AI Sdk
 ex: switching from   openAI to anthropic to Google

 ```bash

 npm install @ai-sdk/anthropic
 npm install @ai-sdk/google


 ```

 - 1 Create an account
 - 2 Get the key 
 - 3 paste into .env.local
   ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY='openai-api-key'
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='anthropic-api-key'
    GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY='api-key'

   ``

-4 Update your code (2 Line change) | 

```js
import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";
import {google} from "@ai-sdk/google"


     streamText({
      //   model: openai("gpt-4.1-nano"),
      // model: anthropic("claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"),
        model: google("gemini-1.5-flash"),
      prompt,
    });
